# Dropout in Neural Networks

## Overview

This notebook explores the implementation and impact of the dropout technique in neural networks. Dropout is a regularization method that involves randomly "dropping out" (i.e., setting to zero) a certain percentage of neurons during each training iteration. This helps prevent overfitting and enhances the generalization capabilities of the model.

## Key Objectives:

1. **Introduction to Dropout**: Understand the concept of dropout and its role in regularization.

2. **Implementation in Keras**: Learn how to implement dropout in neural networks using the Keras framework.

3. **Dropout Rate Tuning**: Experiment with different dropout rates to observe their effects on the model's performance.

4. **Effect on Overfitting**: Investigate how dropout mitigates overfitting and promotes better generalization.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on test data and visualize its training history.

## Considerations:

- Dropout is typically applied during training but not during model evaluation or inference.
- Dropout rates are hyperparameters that can be tuned to achieve the desired regularization effect.
- While dropout is effective in preventing overfitting, excessively high dropout rates may hinder learning.

This notebook serves as a practical guide to implementing and understanding the dropout technique in neural networks, emphasizing its role in regularization and model robustness.
